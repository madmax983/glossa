//! Abstract Syntax Tree for ΓΛΩΣΣΑ
//!
//! The AST captures the semantic structure of a GLOSSA program,
//! preserving morphological information from Greek words.
//!
//! # The Tree Structure
//!
//! The AST hierarchy reflects the grammatical structure of the language:
//!
//! * [`Program`]: The root node, containing a list of statements.
//! * [`Statement`]: A sentence, ending with a period (`.`) or query mark (`?` / `;`).
//!   * A statement consists of one or more [`Clause`]s.
//! * [`Clause`]: A comma-separated part of a statement.
//!   * Example: `ὁ ἄνθρωπος, τὸν λόγον λέγει.` (Two clauses: "The man", "says the word").
//! * [`Expr`]: An expression (word, literal, operation).
//!   * [`Expr::Word`]: A raw Greek word with its original and normalized forms.
//!
//! # Design Philosophy
//!
//! Unlike traditional ASTs that might discard surface-level details, the GLOSSA AST
//! preserves the *original* Greek text in [`Word`] nodes. This is crucial for:
//!
//! 1. **Error Reporting**: Using the original polytonic Greek in error messages.
//! 2. **Morphological Analysis**: The semantic phase needs the original form to
//!    distinguish subtle variations if needed.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! A simple program like `«χαῖρε» λέγε.` produces:
//!
//! ```text
//! Program
//! └── Statement::Regular
//!     └── Clause
//!         ├── Expr::StringLiteral("χαῖρε")
//!         └── Expr::Word("λέγε")
//! ```
