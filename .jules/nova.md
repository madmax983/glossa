# Nova's Journal - The Idea Graveyard

## 🌟 The Oracle (ὁ Μάντις)
**Concept:** A CLI tool (`glossa explain`) that visualizes the semantic assembly process, showing how Greek morphology (case endings) maps to grammatical slots (Subject, Object, Verb).
**Fate:** Merged
**Lesson:** Visualizing the compiler's internal state is powerful for users learning the language. Also, I discovered that the compiler prioritizes Participle analysis for words ending in `-ον` if they aren't in the lexicon, which creates ambiguity for Accusative Nouns.

## 🌟 The Bard (ὁ Ῥαψῳδός)
**Concept:** A semantic syntax highlighter (`glossa highlight`) that colors code based on morphological analysis (Subject=Blue, Object=Red, etc.) instead of regexes.
**Fate:** Merged
**Lesson:** Visualizing the compiler's understanding reveals subtle analysis behaviors (like "λόγον" being potentially analyzed as an Adjective). It proves the morphological engine is robust enough for reverse-mapping.

## 🌟 The Stela (ἡ Στήλη)
**Concept:** A documentation generator (`glossa stela`) that parses comments and code to produce elegant HTML pages styled like ancient inscriptions.
**Fate:** Merged
**Lesson:** Documentation is a bridge between the ancient and modern. Using AST spans to associate comments with code is robust, even when the parser discards comments.
