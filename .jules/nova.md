# Nova's Journal - The Idea Graveyard

## 🌟 The Oracle (ὁ Μάντις)
**Concept:** A CLI tool (`glossa explain`) that visualizes the semantic assembly process, showing how Greek morphology (case endings) maps to grammatical slots (Subject, Object, Verb).
**Fate:** Merged
**Lesson:** Visualizing the compiler's internal state is powerful for users learning the language. Also, I discovered that the compiler prioritizes Participle analysis for words ending in `-ον` if they aren't in the lexicon, which creates ambiguity for Accusative Nouns.

## 🌟 The Bard (ὁ Ῥαψῳδός)
**Concept:** A semantic syntax highlighter (`glossa highlight`) that colors code based on morphological analysis (Subject=Blue, Object=Red, etc.) instead of regexes.
**Fate:** Merged
**Lesson:** Visualizing the compiler's understanding reveals subtle analysis behaviors (like "λόγον" being potentially analyzed as an Adjective). It proves the morphological engine is robust enough for reverse-mapping.

## 🌟 The Mentor (ὁ Μέντωρ)
**Concept:** An interactive tutorial mode (`glossa mentor`) that guides users through learning the language via Socratic challenges. It verifies not just syntax but semantic correctness (e.g., "Create a variable named 'x'").
**Fate:** Merged
**Lesson:** By connecting the `Repl` loop with the `Analyzer`'s internal state, we can create a powerful educational tool that provides real-time feedback. This transforms the compiler from a tool into a teacher.

## 🌟 The Weaver (ὁ Ὑφάντης)
**Concept:** A unified "Rosetta Stone" exporter (`glossa weave`) that generates a Markdown document containing the original source text, the `mosaic` morphological assembly slot table, the `bard` English translation narrative, and the `codegen` final Rust code.
**Fate:** Merged
**Lesson:** Combining disjointed analysis and visualization CLI tools into a single exported document creates an incredible "at-a-glance" debug perspective and educational asset for understanding the language's full pipeline.
