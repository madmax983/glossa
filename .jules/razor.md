## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** `CFGBuilder` in `src/tools/labyrinth.rs` used an object-oriented builder pattern for a simple logic flow.
**Cut:** Flattened the object into pure functions passing mutable references to `nodes`, `edges`, and `node_counter` state.
**Saved:** Replaced a localized object-oriented abstraction with standard procedural Rust functions.

## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** `DotGenerator` in `src/tools/haruspex.rs` used an object-oriented builder pattern for graph generation.
**Cut:** Flattened the object into pure procedural functions passing mutable references to `next_id` and `output` state.
**Saved:** Replaced a localized object-oriented abstraction with standard procedural Rust functions.
## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** Unused `input` variable warning in conditionally compiled CLI arm (`Commands::Gnomon`).
**Cut:** Ignored the bound variable with `let _ = input;` in the `#[cfg(not(feature = "nova"))]` block to satisfy the compiler without changing functionality.
**Saved:** Removed 1 compiler warning (0 cognitive load).
