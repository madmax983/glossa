## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** `TraitMethodCall` enum variant in `AnalyzedExprKind` and its specialized processing functions (like `generate_trait_method_call` and `tell_trait_method_call`). It represented speculative generality where a trait method call had identical compilation and parsing paths to a regular object method.
**Cut:** Removed `TraitMethodCall` entirely and consolidated its path into the existing `MethodCall` node, treating trait methods as regular methods dynamically checked in type space.
**Saved:** Dozens of lines of repeated boilerplate matching rules across parsing, codegen, reporting, and narrative tools. Simplifies the AST and standardizes behavior.
