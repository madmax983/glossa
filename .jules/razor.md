## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** `CFGBuilder` in `src/tools/labyrinth.rs` used an object-oriented builder pattern for a simple logic flow.
**Cut:** Flattened the object into pure functions passing mutable references to `nodes`, `edges`, and `node_counter` state.
**Saved:** Replaced a localized object-oriented abstraction with standard procedural Rust functions.

## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** `DotGenerator` in `src/tools/haruspex.rs` used an object-oriented builder pattern for graph generation.
**Cut:** Flattened the object into pure procedural functions passing mutable references to `next_id` and `output` state.
**Saved:** Replaced a localized object-oriented abstraction with standard procedural Rust functions.
## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** `GnomonVisitor` struct used an object-oriented visitor pattern simply to track maximum nesting depth.
**Cut:** Replaced the struct with a pure `calculate_max_depth(stmt, current_depth)` function.
**Saved:** Flattened unnecessary abstraction.
